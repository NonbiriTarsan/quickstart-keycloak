.Quick Start architecture for KeyCloak on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.svg[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Amazon ECS tasks running with AWS Fargate behind the Application Load Balancer.
** Amazon Aurora Serverless database cluster or Amazon RDS cluster.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* AWS IAM role for Amazon ECS service 
* Secrets from AWS Secrets Manager for KeyCloak console login and database connection.
* Existing certificate from AWS Certificate Manager will be required for custom domain name on Application Load Balancer.
* A Route53 alias record will be required for the custom domain name.


[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
