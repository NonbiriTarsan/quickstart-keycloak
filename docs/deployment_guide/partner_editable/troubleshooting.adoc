*Q.* I encountered a *ERROR - ACM_CERT_ARN not found* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* The CDK deployment requires an existing certificate ARN from AWS Certificate Manager to configure the Application Load Balancer. You will need create the certificate first and pass the certificate ARN as CDK context variable to the CDK CLI.
