image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/keycloak-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks running with AWS Fargate behind the Application Load Balancer.
** Amazon Aurora Serverless database cluster or Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) cluster.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for the Amazon ECS service.
* Secrets from AWS Secrets Manager for {partner-product-short-name} console login and database connection.
* AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) existing certificate, which is required for the custom domain name on the Application Load Balancer.
* Amazon Route 53 alias record, which is required for the custom domain name.
